Hi there, I'm Fengying DANG ! ðŸ‘‹

I am an Assistant Professor at Michigan Technological University (MTU) Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

Prospective Students. Ph.D. candidates are required to email me directly. We also have openings for undergraduate and graduate interns. For students at MTU you can get course credits by doing research with me. For undergraduate students, there are a few programs form university you can apply (REU, SURF) and there is also funding throgh me.

ðŸŒ± Research Interests. My research focuses on improving the intelligence of robot from three distinct but connected topics: (1)how the robot understand the environment they are in; (2) how all the information can be understood correctly together; (3) how the controller can be smartly finish the task. More specifically, I am interested in helping create systems to enable a robot to fully function in complex environments robustly and accurately. My research is focused on designing novel and robust perception and localization system, using both vision and non-vision based sensors. Meanwhile, to help robot work accurately, I also explored learning based control algorithms.
