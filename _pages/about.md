Hi there, I'm Fengying DANG ! ðŸ‘‹

I am an Assistant Professor at Michigan Technological University (MTU) Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

ðŸŒ±Prospective Students. Ph.D. candidates are required to email me directly. We also have openings for undergraduate and graduate interns. MS students interested in doing their Master's Theses in the area of robotics engineering are very welcome to apply. For students at MTU you can get course credits by doing research with me. For undergraduate students, there are a few programs form university you can apply (REU, SURF). GRA or GTA positions are available for outstanding candidates.

ðŸŒ± Research Interests. My research focuses on enhancing robotic intelligence through three interconnected areas: (1) how robots perceive and understand their environment, (2) how sensor data can be effectively utilized, and (3) how to design intelligent control systems. More specifically, I am interested in helping create systems to enable a robot to fully function in complex environments robustly and accurately. My research is focused on designing novel and robust perception and localization system, using both vision and non-vision based sensors. Meanwhile, to help robot work accurately, I also explored learning based control algorithms.
